FixCache
========

What is it?
-----------
FixCache is used to predict faulty files. It processes a database filled in from a source control repository history to identify files which are likely to be buggy.

Dependencies
------------
Versions tested are in parentheses

* Apache Maven 2 (2.2.1)
* Java 1.6
* MySQL 5 (ver 14.14 distrib 5.5.8)
* SQLite 3 (3.6.20)

Database
--------
This distribution of FixCache operates on a MySQL database constructed by [our fork of CVSanalY2](http://github.com/SoftwareIntrospectionLab/cvsanaly) constructed with the following parameters:

    ./cvsanaly2 -g -f config.sqlite --extensions=FileTypes,BugFixMessage,Content,FileCount,Patches,Hunks,HunkBlame --hard-order [repository path]

To allow FixCache to run unit tests without instansiating a database, the unit tests on an in-memory SQLite database. As Java has no standard SQLite library (for shame!), a dependency is downloaded automatically by Maven.


Building and Running with Maven
-------------------------------
FixCache is compiled and run using Maven 2. This allows all the dependencies to be managed for you. As long as you are connected to the Internet, a build should compile cleanly. If you don't have Maven, most *nix package repositories (including MacPorts) have it under `maven2`, otherwise you can download it from the [Maven web site](http://maven.apache.org/download.html).

The standard Maven `mvn clean/build/test/run` goals work, and these are wrapped up in the `RUN` script. You shouldn't need to ever run the `test` goal, but if you do and all the tests don't pass, let us know!

Configuring FixCache
--------------------
First off, you need a MySQL database populated with CVSanalY2 data, as previously described. Next, you'll need to create a file called `database.properties` in the root directory so FixCache knows how to connect to it.

Here's an example `database.properties` file. You shouldn't need to change the Driver configuration, unless you want to use a non-standard MySQL dependency.

    Driver:com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
    URL:jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/fixcache
    UserName:[the user name of your database]
    UserPass:[the password of your database]

Running FixCache
----------------
Once you have an all the data for a given project in the database and a `database.properties` file set up, you can run FixCache directly from the command line.

    Put the parameters here!

If you want to collect file output, you will also need to make an empty directory in the FixCache folder called "Results":

    mkdir Results
