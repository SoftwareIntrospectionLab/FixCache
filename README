What is it?
-----------
FixCache is used to predict faulty files. 


Dependencies
------------------
Database:

FixCache has to read software repository data in mysql database. 
So you have to install mysql for running FixCache.


FixCache needs the following jar files to run, all of which are located in the Jar directory.

dbunit-2.4.8.jar
junit-4.8.1.jar
log4j-1.2.16.jar
mysql-connector-java-5.1.13-bin.jar
slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar
slf4j-simple-1.6.1.jar
joda-time-1.6.2-sources.jar
joda-time-1.6.2.jar



Installing FixCache
-------------------
You need to create a database with tables from cvsanaly. Run mysql as root (mysql -u root -p) and create a new database: 

create database fixcache;
use fixcache;
source ~/path-to-FixCache/fixcache.sql;
show tables;

You need to create a testdatabase.properties file to run DBUnit tests. The database specified in this file will be wiped after running each test. This is the specification for a testdatabase.properties file:

Driver:com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
URL:jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/fixcache
UserName:root
UserPass:

If you want to run fixcache on a larger project, you will need to create a database.properties file for that project.

To build fixcache:
./BUILD


Running FixCache
----------------
Once you have an empty test database and a testdatabase.properties file set up, you can run the FixCache testing suite.

./TEST

All tests should pass. 

To run FixCache on a larger database, set up a database.properties file and then use the run script.

./RUN
