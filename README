What is it?
-----------
FixCache is used to predict faulty files. 


Dependencies
------------------
Database:

FixCache has to read software repository data in mysql database. 
So you have to install mysql for running FixCache.

FixCache has to run the unit tests on sqlite database. So you have to install sqlite for testing FixCache.

Maven:

FixCache is managed by maven. So you have to install maven for tesing, running FixCache.
Using maven, you have to put the pom.xml file in the project path.


Installing FixCache
-------------------
You need to create a database with tables from cvsanaly and create a database.properties file for the connection
to that database. This database.properties file should be in the following format:

Driver:com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
URL:jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/fixcache
UserName:(the user name of your database)
UserPass:(the password of your database)
 
To build fixcache:
./BUILD

Testing FixCache:
Use 'mvn test' from the command line in the project path to run all the unit tests. All the tests should
pass.

Running FixCache
----------------
Once you have an all the data for a given project in the database and a database.properties file set up, you can run the FixCache.

./RUN

If you want to collect file output, you will also need to make an empty directory in the FixCache folder called "Results":

mkdir Results
