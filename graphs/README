In order to generate graphs from a particular run of FixCache, you will need R (http://cran.r-project.org/) and bash installed.

Sample output files are shown with rates.txt and filedist.txt. All R scripts are in the rscripts directory. The CLEAN script removes all pdf files.

To generate the graphs, run:

./makegraphs.bash *rates.txt *filedist.txt

where * is any prefix. Test out with:

./makegraphs.bash rates.txt filedist.txt
